arc v1.4.2 (Release date: 2025-03-27)
==============
Changes

* Added rda version of the humtemp dataset
* Several function arguments were renamed to improve code readability

arc v1.4.1 (Release date: 2023-09-08)
==============
Changes

* Added print method for CBARuleModel

arc v1.4 (Release date: 2023-08-17)
==============
Changes

* CRAN Maintenance release
* Incorporates changes in coercions required by Matrix package (since 1.5-0)
* Updates in README examples
* Added reference to the R Journal article covering arc (Hahsler et al, 2019)
* License changed to GPL-3 from AGPL-3

arc v1.3.3 (Release date: 2020-12-23)
==============
Changes

* Bug fix - in some situations, vector position for confidence score comp. was shifted

arc v1.3.2 (Release date: 2020-11-14)
==============
Changes

* Bug fix - in some situations, two default rules were included on output

arc v1.3.1 (Release date: 2020-11-07)
==============
Changes

* Small improvements in documentation

arc v1.3 (Release date: 2020-09-03)
==============
Changes

* Explainability enhancements: Predict function now supports possibility to output identifiers of rules used for classification and estimates of confidence scores (preview feature, not yet thoroughly tested).
* Improved confidence estimation on the output of the prune function: In addition to standard measured computed by the arules library, new slots are available for each rule -- orderedConf and cumulativeConf. Order-sensitive confidence  is computed only from instances reaching the given rule as a/(a+b), where a is the number of instances matching both the antecedent (available as slot orderedSupp) and consequent and b is the number of instances matching the antecedent, but not matching the consequent of the given rule.  An experimental measure output for each rule is a a cumulative confidence.
* Several small bug fixes and documentation enhancements
* Sync with changes in arules version 1.6-6

arc v1.2 (Release date: 2018-04-13)
==============
Changes

Like in the original CBA paper (Liu et al, 1998), the input rule list is sorted by decreasing confidence, decreasing support, and increasing rule length as the third criterion.

arc v1.1.4 (Release date: 2017-12-26)
==============
Changes

* Added QCBA as a suggested package
* Improved handling of prediction on datasets with no preprocessing
* Increased default rule_window value from 100 to 50.000

arc v1.1.3 (Release date: 2017-11-15)
==============
Changes

* Replaced deprecated evalWithTimeout() with withTimeout()
* Small improvements in source code documentation

arc v1.1.4 (Release date: 2018-8-30)
* it is possible to set target_rule_count and find_conf_supp_thresholds=TRUE simultaneously
