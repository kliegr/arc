\usage{
mdlp2(
  df,
  cl_index = NULL,
  handle_missing = FALSE,
  labels = FALSE,
  skip_nonnumeric = FALSE,
  infinite_bounds = FALSE,
  min_distinct_values = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{input data frame.}

\item{cl_index}{index of the class variable. If not specified, the last column is used as the class variable.}

\item{handle_missing}{Setting to TRUE activates the following behaviour: if there are any missing observations in the column processed,
the input for discretization is a subset of data containing this column and target with rows containing missing values excuded.}

\item{labels}{A logical indicating whether the bins of the discretized data should be represented by integer codes or as interval notation using (a;b] when set to TRUE.}

\item{skip_nonnumeric}{If set to TRUE, any non-numeric columns will be skipped.}

\item{infinite_bounds}{A logical indicating how the bounds on the extremes should look like.}

\item{min_distinct_values}{If a column contains less than specified number of distinct values, it is not discretized.}
}
\value{
Discretized data. If there were any non-numeric input columns they are returned as is. All returned columns except class are factors.
}
\description{
Performs supervised discretization of numeric columns, except class, on the provided data frame. Uses the Minimum Description Length Principle algorithm (Fayyed and Irani, 1993) as implemented in the discretization package.
}
\examples{
  mdlp2(datasets::iris) #gives the same result as mdlp(datasets::iris) from discretize package
  #uses Sepal.Length as target variable
  mdlp2(df=datasets::iris, cl_index = 1,handle_missing = TRUE, labels = TRUE,
  skip_nonnumeric = TRUE, infinite_bounds = TRUE, min_distinct_values = 30)
