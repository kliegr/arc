\title{Performs supervised discretization.}
\usage{
mdlp2(df, cl_index = NULL, handle_missing = FALSE, labels = FALSE,
  skip_nonnumeric = FALSE, infinite_bounds = FALSE,
  min_distinct_values = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{input data frame.}

\item{cl_index}{index of the class variable. If not specified, the last column is used as the class variable.}

\item{handle_missing}{Setting to TRUE activates the following behaviour: if there are any missing observations in the column processed,
the input for discretization is a subset of data containing this column and target with rows containing missing values excuded.}

\item{labels}{A logical indicating whether the bins of the discretized data should be represented by integer codes or as interval notation using (a;b] when set to TRUE.}

\item{skip_nonnumeric}{If set to TRUE, any non-numeric columns will be skipped.}

\item{infinite_bounds}{A logical indicating how the bounds on the extremes should look like.}

\item{min_distinct_values}{If a column contains less than specified number of distinct values, it is not discretized.}
}
\value{
Discretized data. If there were any non-numeric input columns they are returned as is. All returned columns except class are factors.
}
\description{
Performs supervised discretization.
}
\examples{
  mdlp2(iris) #gives the same result as mdlp(iris) from discretize package
  #uses Sepal.Length as target variable
  mdlp2(df=iris,cl_index=1,handle_missing=TRUE,labels=TRUE,
  skip_nonnumeric=TRUE,infinite_bounds=TRUE,min_distinct_values=30)
